# Coffee Turbo order maker
>`PRACTICE PROJECT` for Googles Udacity Android Developement Course

Coffee Turbo order maker is my practice project for a part of Android Development Scholarship that focused on getting more experience in working with Java. The aim of this project was to create an app that can be used to order coffee in a care/restaurant. It should have an option where the user can provide name, select number of coffees and have a selection of toppings to choose from. Price calculation should be done automatically and an order summary should be provided which the user can send by email.
